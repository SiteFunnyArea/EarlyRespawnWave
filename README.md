# ERW (EarlyRespawnWave)

EarlyRespawnWave is a plugin on the SiteFunnyArea SCP:SL Heavily Modded Server, EarlyRespawnWave gives people who die early into the game, or early into the first MTF/CI spawnwave, a second chance at life by doing a early-game CustomRole spawnwave a few minutes into the game/spawnwave.

# ERW Tickets
How ERW determines what someone should spawn as is quite easy right now, once a player dies, if they are classified as a 'passive' role (such as Scientist, Mobile Task Force, Facility Guard) they will spawn as a Rapid Response Team member, meanwhile players who are classified as having a 'non-passive' role (such as SCPs, Class-D, Chaos Insurgency) will spawn as a Infiltration Insurgency Squad member.

This system will be replaced with a new one soon though.

# When Does A Early Spawnwave Occur
By default, in the config, an early spawnwave occurs after 2 minutes and 30 seconds after a game begins, and also 2 minutes and 30 seconds after the first spawnwave occurs. 

Those are the only two times an early spawnwave occurs.

# ERW Spawnable Teams
There are three teams right now that a player can spawn as when a early-game spawnwave occurs

| Team Name  | Role Type | Total Roles  | What Wave Do They Spawn |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Rapid Response Team  | NtfPrivate  | 1  | First Wave (start of game)  |
| Infiltration Insurgency Squad  | ChaosConscript  | 1  | First Wave (start of game)   |
| Serpents Hand  | Tutorial  | 8  | Second Wave (first MTF/CI spawnwave)  |
